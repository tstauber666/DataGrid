## Simple TableView using SQL-Relation as DropDown Data-File in QML

I'm using qt 6.4.
I've changed masterdetail example to qml. It's work fine until using HorizontalHeaderView. (main.qml).
If i use HorizontalHeaderView the ComboBox freeze and the new features of QMl TableView working no more. 

Whats wrong ?
Please Help me.
